# Cryptography-and-Neural-Network-Project

## DISTINGUISHING RANDOM BITSTREAM FROM HAMMING ENCODED BITSTREAM

### My internship was carried out at Defence Research and Development Organization(DRDO), New Delhi. My area of work was Deep Neural Networks and Cryptography.

Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised. Deep neural networks are the networks that have an input layer, an output layer and at least one hidden layer in between. Each layer performs specific types of sorting and ordering in a process that some refer to as “feature hierarchy.” One of the key uses of these sophisticated neural networks is dealing with unlabeled or unstructured data.  

Cryptography is the art of creating written or generated codes that allow information to be kept secret. Cryptography converts data into a format that is unreadable for an unauthorized user, allowing it to be transmitted without unauthorized entities decoding it back into a readable format, thus compromising the data. Information security uses cryptography on several levels. The information cannot be read without a key to decrypt it.

There are various types of concepts and libraries we studied about, some common concepts and libraries include: Tensorflow, Keras, RNN, CNN, LSTM, GRU, Sequential, Max pooling, Dense, etc
